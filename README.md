# Sudoku_Solver
A project whose aim is to determine the efficiency between a model that solves sudoku and a sudoku solver method. also aim to deploy so users can take pictures of real life problems and get an answer in response. maybe implement a hint system too
<br>
### TO DO

Creating the fundementals
1. Create all five generator methods
2. Create a validator
3. Create a solver
4. from the generator output succefully create a semi filled board (a method to remove values at random)
5. test validator and solver on problems generated
6. store mulitple problems
7. prep data for a model
8. create model
9. test model vs solver on testing data
10. check results

### Side porjects

1. create Gui for users to use models themselves
2. allow users to play any sudoku they find my taking a picture with thier mobile device and having it transfered
3. implement a hint method
